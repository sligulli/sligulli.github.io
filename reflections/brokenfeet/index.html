    <br> <div class="text-justify"><p>How many of us have never banged a toe against a hard and immovable object? Not many of us, I guess. Most of us have done it many times.</p>

<p>I treated 2 people who did this and a metatarsal bone broke.</p>

<p>The first texted me an x-ray me on a Friday afternoon the day after she  broke the 4th right metatarsal, and I arranged to go over to her house. This was around October 2018. You can see the break in the attached image.</p>

<p><img src="/images/brokentoe.png#center" alt="" /></p>

<p>Her foot looked bad. It was very swollen down around the entire ball of the foot, and the dorsal area was starting to turn black and blue.</p>

<p>I treated her with the Chinese trauma medicine I studied, and that was that.</p>

<p>When I saw her again on the following Tuesday, she was walking normally in a pair of those flimsy flats women wear, and she reported that the effects were amazing. The swelling and bruising was totally gone, and she was bustling all over as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>In a matter of 5 days she had recovered enough to go about her usual business including driving, which means, of course, using the right foot to work the pedals.</p>

<p>The 2nd person I treated a couple of weeks ago. She&rsquo;d been in one of those boots for broken feet and ankles for about 6 weeks. She broke her left 5th metatarsal. The top end of her foot and toes stuck out of the boot, and it was swollen and severely bruised. Circulation to her left foot was obviously poor.</p>

<p>What they both did correctly was go to a medical facility to get the diagnosis based on an x-ray.</p>

<p>The difference was that the 1st woman sought a Chinese medicinal treatment immediately after receiving her x-ray. She was walking normally 5 days after her injury, while the 2nd was still hobbling around in a boot after 6 weeks with 2 more to go.</p>

<p>This works in cases of sprains, strains, and simple bone breaks that can&rsquo;t be set. The sooner following the injury the better, and ice will only make your injury worse.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s something to consider.</p>
