Hey.  
I admire bad plants.  
I admire plants fallen into widespread disrepute & disfavor.  
I admire plants branded as invasive, whether native or not.  
I admire plant notoriety & those designated as illegal or even (gasp) evil.  
I admire plants blamed for what invariably turns out to be willful human ignorance.  
I admire plants blamed for what may, perhaps, turn out to be unintended human ignorance.  
I admire plants blamed for what honestly turns out to be human misuse and abuse.

I admire & respect dense vegetal tangles & thorny resilience.  
I applaud plants run amok in an effort to fill, protect, & heal areas damaged by human design.

Hey.  
The best way to enter an impenetrable thicket is to ask for permission.  
Leave the machete to rust.  
The best way to enter an impenetrable thicket is to ask for permission slip in & sit.
