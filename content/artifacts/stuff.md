Then, he said, I gotta hand it to you,  
an accumulation of stuff is no  
success, while disregard for language equals  
failure. If anyone were to claim that  

my car were broken into, but all that was  
missing were some change and a swiss army  
knife, the next question should be where's the damage.  
Haphazard at best, meaning evaporates.  

Winter begins. Roots and seeds sink in  
to the ground. Bent face in cold flurries without,  
cold wind raging within. Trapezius  

twitching, a knot in the neck. Daily speech  
breaks down. Lone man a tool to nothing but  
furies. Discourtesy unglued prevails.
