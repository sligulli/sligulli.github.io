Colorado, stunningly cursed by the visual  
effects it evokes in humans, is yet one  
of many categorical impositions on an other  
wise unbroken map. How did it come to be  

so stupidly square? Colorado could be said to be tall  
but not tall enough to escape the distances  
between the dull wit of its tracing, likewise,  
the concrete nuances of who’s doing the taking.  

Glassy eyed automatons boxed into triviality, this package  
transcribes a peripheral indulgence wherein arrivals  
conceptualize a tangle of crippled roadway, a damaged  

matériel device. Wind through timber diminished in ice  
and a vertical crag, where, and toward what end, does  
one inscribe upon this breeding enormity a proprietary line?
