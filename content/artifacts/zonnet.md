Seventh decade and still not so smart, what  
does it mean to go out of my mind, as if   
that were possible? Zenith, my second,  
of which I is a shadow oftime over  

shadowed (Picture this as concrete. Form  
a mental image of this process), Zenith,  
my mother, when all preconceptions turn  
upside down. The cycle is more than a  

man, man wrong, as usual. To right whatever  
rolls over simply occurs without the need  
to consult calendar or clock. Heat and  

more heat, sometimes we sizzle, pop, and  
explode. Never an organizational wizard,  
what does it mean to seek inchoate arcana?
