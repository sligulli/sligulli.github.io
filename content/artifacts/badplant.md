At a depot between what is and what  
isn't breathing, a steady rhythm shall  
suffice. Alone with a drum is all any  
one needs to travel. Mismatched rattles, one  
  
in each hand, matter and spirit carry  
us to a good place. A steady rhythm  
unwinds the tangle and rounds all a whirl.  
Sometimes we move under, other times  
  
up. Life an illusion, Tobacco rips  
a pinhole in the distant horizon  
raising an approaching cloud ocher.  
  
The pink Chevelle SS 454, brakes locked,  
skids to a 360 stop, engine rumbling,  
mere inches away, and waits for its rider.
