As it is without, so it is within.  
Where water meets land, land shall meet water.  
Between earth and sky stands a two legged  
speck. His thin path opens a trade route.  

Water carries away the poisons he  
makes until all water becomes deadly.  
As it is without, so shall it be with  
in. Plant life cleanses air and water. He  

cuts and burns trees that have managed to stand  
for over five hundred years. He plugs  
great rivers until those rivers run dry.  

Sometimes it's better to stop here and sit.  
Sometimes it's best to sit and do nothing.  
Allow heart to open to each instant enchant.
