Old guy snoozing supine beneath a stiff  
westerly chill on a beach beyond the mouth  
of the Hoh. Shades of grey highlight  
his wizened complexion while ravens feast  

on his eyeballs. Supposing he dreams, he's  
astonished when waking and rubbing his  
hollowed sockets. Blindly stumbling over  
and beyond piled and long weathered tide  

stranded timber into the forest, his hand  
touches usnea which he stuffs into the holes  
where eyes once snuggled restoring luminous  

imagery enhanced, eidetic inner depths and  
distances coalescent exceeding anything  
he previously may have ever imagined.
