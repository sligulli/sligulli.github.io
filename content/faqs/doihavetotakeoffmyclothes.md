No! You do not necessarily have to take off your clothes. However, if you want cupping, gua sha, or moxa it may be easier to either move loose clothing or remove a shirt and cover up under a sheet.  

On the other hand, almost all acupuncture treatments are conducted on people in the supine (face-up) position, and the most commonly used points are on the arms, hands, legs, and feet.  

So all you need to do is wear loose clothing.  

If you need help with a shoulder problem (for example), access to that area might help. But long sleeves still won't generally prevent acupuncture from facilitating improvement with shoulder problems.  

Those tight tight elastic pants so popular now do occasionally limit access some excellent points, but we can work around that also.  

Still, loose clothing is best; circulation of blood and qi all the way down into the toes and fingertips is a good thing.  

The choice of acupuncture points is fluid and adaptive. We can always find work-around or alternative solutions.  

And don’t worry if you haven’t had time to shave your legs for a couple of days.  

We don’t judge your bodies.  

Believe it or not, we have bodies too.  

And we simply want to help you feel better.
