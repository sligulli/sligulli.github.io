_Healing with Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition_ by Paul Pitchford  

This is an indispensible book on food as medicine and herbal medicine as nutrition. It is quite thorough and well-researched. Use it as a reference.

For those who ask if acupuncture can help reduce weight, yes, it can, but you'll increase your chances of success if you follow advice found in this book in conjunction with weekly acupuncture treatments for at least a year.
