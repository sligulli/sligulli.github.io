_Atlas of Chinese Tongue Diagnosis_ by Barbara Kirschbaum  

This is the best reference book on tongue diagnosis, and anyone should be able to begin using this book to learn this excellent diagnostic technique.

The photos of tongues are consistent and sharp, while the combination of western and Chinese diagnostic terminology according to what each tongue shows deepens understanding into the the similarities and differences between the two modalities.

Beyond merely providing an atlas of tongue pictures and descriptions, several in-depth case studies are also provided which correspond to changes on the tongue as health improves.
