it even isn't // I  

outside one self I am he who looks out from inside  
a serial experience  
  
he is merely the voice of that which precedes him  
and sometimes spots beauty  
  
by an act of naming it such  
that it is as he imagines when it even isnâ€™t  
  
I call I that when looking upon a dead apple  
tree with one low lifting branch  
  
tightly budded in deep rose blooms yet to unfold  
all under an early day drizzle

*For those who feel indecisive about the sliding-scale fee structure,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acupuncture can help with that too!
