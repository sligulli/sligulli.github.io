Individual needs vary; acupuncture works cumulatively.  

More frequent the treatments tend to result in more positive outcomes.  

Acupuncture is a PROCESS. How many times have you picked up a prescription for 1 pill?  

In China, it is common for people to come for treatments 6 days a week with 2 off for 6-8 weeks.  

Most people do not need that much acupuncture. But a series of 1-3 treatments per week for several weeks is generally recommended. This is how the sliding scale fee system allows for more effective outcomes than private treatments at $75 per visit.  

At the same time, a lot of us are like an old guitar string. We can get that string in tune, but it doesnâ€™t stay that way for long.  

Some people find that treatments once per week or twice per month work wonders as a tune-up or preventive strategy, and many simply learn to sense when an acpuncture treatment is needed.
