#### What is community acupuncture?

Community acupuncture is a business model where treatments take place in a common room as opposed to one which is private. The advantage of this setup allows the business to charge lower fees by providing access to more people to receive treatments at once.  

For those who may feel uncomfortable talking about personal information in an open clinic setting, free phone consultations are available at eight-two-eight four-five-zero three-seven-two-one.
