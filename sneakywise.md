Once we become servile to the hunger of our  
lovely machines, once we learn thirst for those  
poisons these beauties demand, once we ruin  
the future of those who are young or yet  

to be born, those children whose hopes we have  
recklessly squandered, what might we choose  
to do next? Human dead end, a closed circuit,  
no answers hide inside an electronic  

device. Perhaps we might instead tune an ear  
toward the voice of an oak, a spiky thistle,  
green trickster potions, open our hearts toward  

external reflections. Lovely indeed bosky  
speaks she, the sneaky wise sister. Lovely  
indeed to lose self in some snarly weed.
